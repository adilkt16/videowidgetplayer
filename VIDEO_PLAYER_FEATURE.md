# Video Player in Configuration Feature

## Overview

The widget configuration now includes a **full video player** that allows users to watch their selected videos directly within the configuration screen. This provides a complete preview experience before adding the widget to the home screen.

## New Features

### 1. Integrated Video Player
- **PlayerView Integration**: Uses ExoPlayer's PlayerView for full video playback
- **Visual Player**: Shows actual video content, not just thumbnails
- **Audio Playback**: Videos play with full audio
- **Standard Controls**: Play, pause, seek, volume controls
- **Fullscreen Experience**: 200dp height player with proper aspect ratio

### 2. Enhanced Video Preview Experience
- **Play Button Action**: Tapping the play button in the video list now opens the full video player
- **Video Information Display**: Shows the video title in the player overlay
- **Close Player Option**: X button to close the player and return to the list
- **Auto-pause on End**: Videos automatically pause when reaching the end
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### 3. Player Lifecycle Management
- **Proper Resource Management**: Player is properly created and released
- **Activity Lifecycle**: Player pauses on activity pause, resumes on resume
- **Memory Efficient**: Player resources are cleaned up on activity destroy
- **Background Handling**: Player stops when app goes to background

## Technical Implementation

### Layout Changes
- Added `PlayerView` component in a `FrameLayout` container
- Overlay with video title and close button
